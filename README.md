About the Project
In this project, the STSPIN820 driver is used to precisely and reliably control stepper motors. The driver features a TOFF timer for controlling the off-time of the motor, and uses various pins to activate the motor and adjust its speed.

Requirements
The components needed for this project are:

STSPIN820 Stepper Motor Driver
Stepper Motor (Unipolar or Bipolar)
2x 8-pin Headers (for pin connections)
Microcontroller (ESP32, Arduino, STM32, etc.)
12V or 24V Power Supply (depending on motor voltage)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Connections
The pin connections to the STSPIN820 driver are as follows:

SNS A: Current sensing for motor phase A.
SNS B: Current sensing for motor phase B.
StandBy: Puts the motor into low power mode.
EN/FAULT: Enables the motor and monitors fault conditions.
REF: Sets the current reference voltage.
MOTOR VOLTAGE: The motor power supply voltage (typically 12V or 24V).
MODE: Selects the micro-stepping mode.
TOFF: Controls the driver's off-time, used to optimize motor performance.
8-Pin Headers
In this project, 8-pin headers are used for motor connections and control signals.
Setup
Hardware Connections:

Connect the STSPIN820 driver to your microcontroller and stepper motor.
Connect the A and B phases of the motor to the driver.
Connect the SNS A and SNS B pins to the appropriate resistors for current sensing.
Use digital I/O pins on the microcontroller to control the EN/FAULT and StandBy pins.
Configure the REF and MODE pins to adjust motor speed and micro-stepping mode.
Software Setup:

Download the necessary libraries for your microcontroller (e.g., Arduino IDE or PlatformIO).
In your code, control the EN/FAULT and StandBy pins to activate the motor.
TOFF Setting:

Adjust the off-time of the motor using the TOFF parameter. This setting helps optimize the motor's speed and efficiency.
Usage
After assembling the circuit, connect your microcontroller to your computer.
Compile and upload the code.
Use the MODE pin to select the stepping mode (full-step, half-step, micro-step).
Activate the motor by controlling the EN/FAULT pin, and monitor the motorâ€™s operation.
Adjust the motor's speed and direction using a control interface, such as code or a potentiometer.
